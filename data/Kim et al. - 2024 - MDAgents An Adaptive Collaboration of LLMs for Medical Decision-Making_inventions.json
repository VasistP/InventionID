    "invention_name": "Medical Decision-making Agents Framework",
    "technical_description": "The MDAgents framework utilizes multiple large language models (LLMs) to adaptively structure collaboration for medical decision-making. It assesses the complexity of medical queries and recruits appropriate specialists to address them. This dynamic approach mirrors real-world medical practices, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.",
    "problem_statement": "Current medical decision-making processes often lack the adaptability needed to handle varying complexities in patient cases. Traditional methods may not effectively integrate diverse medical expertise, leading to suboptimal outcomes.",
    "solution_approach": "MDAgents addresses this issue by dynamically assigning roles to LLMs based on the assessed complexity of medical queries. This allows for tailored collaboration among specialists, improving the accuracy and reliability of medical diagnoses.",
