    "invention_name": "MDAgents: Adaptive LLM Collaboration for Medical Decision-Making",
    "technical_description": "The MDAgents framework is a novel multi-agent system that dynamically assigns collaboration structures to a team of Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical decision-making. It emulates hierarchical diagnosis procedures, adapting the LLM team's structure (solo, multidisciplinary, or integrated care) based on the assessed complexity of the medical task. This adaptive approach optimizes for both efficiency and accuracy across diverse medical tasks.",
    "problem_statement": "Leveraging LLMs effectively in complex medical tasks remains an open challenge, as existing generalist multi-agent LLM designs often fail to integrate real-world systematic medical decision-making processes that require adaptive, collaborative, and tiered approaches. Static multi-agent architectures can lead to suboptimal configurations and computational inefficiency when applied to a wide variety of medical tasks.",
    "solution_approach": "MDAgents addresses this by dynamically assessing the medical query's complexity (low, moderate, high) and then recruiting an appropriate team of specialist LLM agents with a tailored collaboration structure. For low complexity, a single agent is used; for moderate, a Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT); and for high, an Integrated Care Team (ICT). This adaptive recruitment and collaborative discussion process, including moderator review and external knowledge integration, leads to a more accurate and efficient diagnosis.",
