    "invention_name": "Medical Decision-Making Agents Framework",
    "technical_description": "The MDAgents framework utilizes multiple large language models (LLMs) to adaptively structure collaboration among agents based on the complexity of medical queries. It incorporates a medical complexity check, expert recruitment, and a multi-step decision-making process to enhance accuracy in medical diagnosis.",
    "problem_statement": "Medical decision-making is often complex and requires collaboration among various specialists. Traditional methods may not effectively address the varying complexities of medical cases, leading to suboptimal outcomes.",
    "solution_approach": "MDAgents dynamically assigns roles to LLMs based on the assessed complexity of the medical query, allowing for tailored collaboration. This approach optimizes the decision-making process by integrating insights from multiple medical experts.",

    "invention_name": "Adaptive Medical Complexity Classification",
    "technical_description": "This invention involves a method for classifying medical queries into low, moderate, or high complexity using a large language model. The classification informs the recruitment of appropriate medical experts for collaborative decision-making.",
    "problem_statement": "Accurate classification of medical query complexity is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. Misclassification can lead to inappropriate resource allocation and ineffective medical interventions.",
    "solution_approach": "The framework employs a moderator LLM to evaluate the complexity of medical queries, ensuring that the right level of expertise is engaged based on the complexity classification. This adaptive approach enhances the efficiency of the medical decision-making process.",
