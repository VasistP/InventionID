    "invention_name": "Integrated System for Catheter Biofilm Detection and Treatment",
    "technical_description": "This integrated system seamlessly incorporates flexible, interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) into a commercial Foley urinary catheter via a 3D-printed insert. It performs real-time impedance-based sensing for bacterial growth detection and applies bioelectric effect-based treatment for biofilm reduction. The system is wirelessly controlled through a custom application communicating with a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) via Bluetooth, ensuring user-friendly operation and maintaining the catheter's primary functions.",
    "problem_statement": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a major healthcare-acquired infection, primarily driven by antibiotic-tolerant bacterial biofilms on indwelling catheters. Current detection methods are slow and reactive, leading to infection progression, while widespread antibiotic use fosters resistance.",
    "solution_approach": "The system provides a proactive, device-based approach for CAUTI management by enabling prompt, real-time detection of bacterial growth via impedance changes. It then facilitates targeted biofilm reduction using a synergistic bioelectric effect (low-intensity electric field combined with reduced antibiotic dosage), thereby minimizing antibiotic resistance and improving treatment efficacy.",

    "invention_name": "Method for Real-time Catheter Biofilm Monitoring and Bioelectric Treatment",
    "technical_description": "This method involves continuously monitoring bacterial biofilm formation on an indwelling urinary catheter by measuring impedance changes via integrated flexible electrodes. Upon detecting a significant decrease in impedance (e.g., 13.0% for E. coli), indicating bacterial growth, a bioelectric effect (BE) treatment is initiated. This BE treatment applies a low-intensity electric field (e.g., 20 kHz sine wave) synergistically with low-dose antimicrobials to increase bacterial susceptibility and reduce biofilm biomass.",
    "problem_statement": "Current clinical practices for managing catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are often reactive, relying on delayed symptom onset or culture results, which allows biofilm-driven infections to progress. High antibiotic dosages required for biofilm treatment contribute to antimicrobial resistance.",
    "solution_approach": "The method enables proactive CAUTI management through real-time, continuous monitoring of biofilm formation, allowing for early intervention before severe infection develops. By employing the bioelectric effect, it enhances the efficacy of low-dose antimicrobials, reducing the overall antibiotic requirement and combating the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",
