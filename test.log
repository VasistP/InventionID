          "evidence_quote": "This work introduces an integrated system incorporated seamlessly with a commercial Foley urinary catheter for bacterial growth sensing and biofilm treatment. Methods: The system is comprised of flexible, interdigitated electrodes incorporated with a urinary catheter via a 3D-printed insert for impedance sensing and bioelectric effect-based treatment. Each of the functions were wirelessly controlled using a custom application that provides a user-friendly interface for communicating with a custom PCB via Bluetooth to facilitate implementation in practice.",
          "reasoning": "The paper explicitly describes a tangible 'integrated system' and 'modified catheter system' which is a manufactured product and apparatus. It details its components (electrodes, 3D-printed insert, PCB, mobile application) and their functions for bacterial detection and biofilm treatment, clearly defining what it is and how it operates."

          "evidence_quote": "In this work we present an integrated system for bacterial monitoring and treatment on indwelling Foley catheters. A 3D-printable insert module has been designed to allow integration of interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) with a commercially available urinary catheter... The IDE based sensor is fabricated on a flexible polyimide substrate and is controlled wirelessly using a custom designed printed circuit board (PCB) and a custom mobile application.",
          "reasoning": "The work presents a fully specified, reproducible mechanism, including detailed hardware (3D-printed insert, flexible IDEs, custom PCB with specific ICs like AD5933, AD2S99, BGM121 MCU) and custom software (mobile app, firmware). It goes beyond a mere conceptual idea by detailing the architecture and operational steps for implementation."

          "evidence_quote": "The integrated catheter system maintains the primary functions of indwelling catheters - urine drainage, balloon inflation - while being capable of detecting the growth of Escherichia coli, with an average decrease in impedance of 13.0% after 24 hours, tested in a newly-developed simulated bladder environment. Furthermore, the system enables bioelectric effect-based biofilm reduction, which is performed by applying a low-intensity electric field that increases the susceptibility of biofilm bacteria to antimicrobials, ultimately reducing the required antibiotic dosage.",
          "reasoning": "The paper provides quantitative, objective evidence of the system's performance, including a 13.0% decrease in impedance for bacterial detection and a statistically significant reduction in biofilm biomass (P < 0.05) with bioelectric effect treatment, all demonstrated in a realistic in vitro bladder model. This shows measurable improvement over a defined baseline."

It includes a concrete, reproducible technical implementation with custom hardware (electrodes, 3D-printed insert, custom PCB) and software (mobile app, firmware). The system demonstrates measurable performance improvements, such as a 13.0% decrease in impedance for bacterial detection and a significant reduction in biofilm biomass, validated in a realistic in vitro model.
